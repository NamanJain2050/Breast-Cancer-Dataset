# Breast-Cancer-Dataset

In this notebook I have provided my analysis on Breast Cancer Dataset obtained from UCI Dataset Repository.
1. I've applied simple LR to fit the model
2. I've used metrics like ROC-AUC to measure the performace of our model
3. Applied feature enigineering to remove strongly correlated features
4. Applied <b>Linear Outlier Factor</b> technique to remove outliers

At last, I was able to achieve 100% accuracy on test data (part of original data I set aside)
